# Platform Trials
My second real game, this time made in Godot!

Use the arrow keys or WAD to move your knight left, right, or jump (using the up arrow key, W, space, or enter) and collect the 9 gold coins.

## Game
### Features
- A simple level
- Animated sprites
- Moving platform!!!
- Nice background music
- Coin collect sound
- Nice background with well made sprites

### Credits
I used Brackeys's [amazingly well done tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0&t=2456s)â€‹ on game development with Godot and I recreated the game he makes in it using his videos as a reference as needed.

Thanks to Brackeys for getting me started and for all the resources used in the game which can be found [here](https://brackeysgames.itch.io/brackeys-platformer-bundle)!
